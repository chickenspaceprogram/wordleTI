# wordleTI
### A port of Wordle to TI-BASIC

v0.1 (alpha)

wordleTI is currently still in development, and is incomplete.

What things do:

readme.md    - You are here

testing.py   - A python script for testing some of the algorithms used

makestrs.py  - A python script to convert validwords.txt and answers.txt into a format usable by graphing calculators

validwords.txt - Contains every word you're allowed to enter in Wordle.

answers.txt - Contains Wordle's original solutions list. These have changed since Wordle was purchased by the New York Times.
